# Getting-Cleaning_Data_Project
Course Project Task--Getting and Cleaning Data
Course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course where the `run_analysis.R` R Script performs the following actions:

•	Download the identified dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
•	Loads the activity and attribute info
•	The training and test datasets load, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
•	Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
•	Merges the two datasets
•	Converts the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors
•	Creates a tidy dataset that is made up of the average (mean) values of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The deliverable results are within the file `tidy.txt`.
